<h1>Thinking Shit Up</h1>
<p><em>A place to put ideas before they pretend to be finished.</em></p>

<h2>What This Is</h2>
<p>
This is where thoughts go when they’re not ready to behave.
Some will turn into essays.
Some will turn into side notes.
Most will stay exactly as provisional as they deserve.
</p>

<h2>What This Is Not</h2>
<p>
This is not a brand.
It is not a system.
It does not have a cadence, a funnel, or a mission statement.
</p>

<p>
There will be no attempt to sound definitive.
Any appearance of certainty is accidental.
</p>

<h2>How This Works</h2>
<p>
Ideas show up.
They get written down.
Sometimes they improve.
Sometimes they don’t.
</p>

<p>
Either way, writing them makes the next one easier.
</p>

<p><em>All ideas subject to revision without notice.</em></p>
